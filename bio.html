    <div id="bio"><p>I am a senior at Tufts University pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering. I graduate in May of 2015 but will be spending one more year at Tufts to pursue an M.S. in Mechanical Engineering. I am currently conducting research under my advisor Professor Marc Hodes which will cumulate in my Masters' thesis. The topic of this research is analytic analysis of fluid and heat behavior relating to the field of thermal management of electronics. During my time at Tufts I found a passion and aptitude for Computer Science, which has since become my minor.</p>     
   <p>I am originally from Northampton, Massachusetts and have always loved all kinds of sports, from football to skiing and everything in between. I am interested in finding new ways to integrate my knowledge of software and hardware for practical applications.</p>
